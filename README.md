Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze the lyrical content of Taylor Swift's songs, focusing on references to
time (day, night, midnight) and performing a sentiment analysis to track emotional tone across her albums.
The project will produce a clear, data-driven overview of how frequently these themes occur, how their
sentiment evolves over time, and whether Taylor Swift writes more positively about day or night. This will be
completed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python libraries for text analysis, and results will
be visualized in graphs for a comprehensive understanding by December 15, 2024.

SMART Elements:
• Specific: Analyze Taylor Swift’s lyrics for references to time (day, night, midnight) and perform
sentiment analysis.

• Measurable: The frequency of keyword mentions and sentiment scores (positive, negative,
neutral, compound) will be used as measurable indicators.

• Assignable: Assigned to Abhrajit, responsible for completing the data analysis and reporting
findings.

• Realistic: The project will be executed using publicly available datasets and Python libraries
such as pandas, nltk, and matplotlib.

• Time-related: The analysis and report will be completed by December 15, 2024.

Objectives:
1. Outcome: Identify and count all references to “midnight,” “day,” and “night” in Taylor Swift’s song
lyrics.

a. Time Frame: By November 1, 2024

b. Measure: Create keyword frequency counts.

c. Action: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean the data and search for
these keywords in the lyrics.

2. Outcome: Conduct sentiment analysis on the lyrics that mention “day” and “night” to determine their
emotional tone.

a. Time Frame: By November 15, 2024

b. Measure: Compare positive, negative, neutral, and compound scores for day and night-related
lyrics.

c. Action: Use sentiment analysis tools from nltk to classify and score sentiment.

3. Outcome: Visualize trends in time-related mentions and sentiment over the course of Taylor Swift’s
career.

a. Time Frame: By November 30, 2024.

b. Measure: Generate line graphs, bar charts, and word clouds.

c. Action: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations.

4. Outcome: Produce a final report summarizing the findings and provide insights into how Taylor
Swift's sentiment regarding time has evolved.

a. Time Frame: By December 15, 2024.

b. Measure: Completion of a final report with charts and sentiment breakdowns.

c. Action: Compile the findings into a structured document with visual support.
