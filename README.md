PROJECT OVERVIEW STATEMENT

Project Name: Sentiment and Theme Analysis in Taylor Swift's Lyrics Using NLP and Machine Learning Models	

Student Name: Abhrajit Das

Problem/Opportunity:
This project explores how time-related references (e.g., day, night, midnight) in Taylor Swift's lyrics have evolved throughout her career and investigates how these references align with the sentiment expressed in her songs. This analysis bridges a gap in understanding lyrical patterns and emotional tones, offering insights into her artistic evolution and how sentiment varies between time themes.


Goal:
The project aims to analyze the lyrical content of Taylor Swift's songs to track the frequency of time-related themes ("day," "night," and "midnight") and perform sentiment analysis to uncover emotional trends across her albums. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning models, and Python libraries, the project seeks to deliver a clear, data-driven report by December 17, 2024
SMART Elements:
1.	Specific:
Analyze Taylor Swift’s lyrics for references to time (day, night, midnight) and conduct sentiment analysis for emotional tone.
2.	Measurable:
Use keyword frequency counts and sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) as measurable indicators.
3.	Assignable:
Assigned to Abhrajit, who is responsible for executing analysis, modeling, and reporting findings.
4.	Realistic:
Publicly available datasets and Python libraries (e.g., pandas, nltk, matplotlib) will be used to execute the analysis.
5.	Time-related:
The report will be completed by December 10, 2024, with the final presentation by December 17, 2024.


Objectives:
1.	Outcome:
Perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Taylor Swift's lyrics.

a.	Time Frame: By October 15, 2024

b.	Measure: Identify word frequencies, visualize distributions, and preprocess data for NLP tasks.

c.	Action: Use Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data exploration and cleaning.

3.	Outcome:
Train and evaluate machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis.

a.	Time Frame: By November 12, 2024

b.	Measure: Assess accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall of models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM).

c.	Action: Implement various models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow to predict sentiment classes (positive, neutral, negative).

5.	Outcome:
Refine the models and explore additional algorithms to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.

a.	Time Frame: By December 3, 2024

b.	Measure: Track model accuracy and performance metrics for each iteration.

c.	Action: Optimize hyperparameters and train additional models for comparative evaluation.

7.	Outcome:
Finalize the research paper with comprehensive findings and visualizations.

a.	Time Frame: By December 10, 2024

b.	Measure: Complete a structured research paper with analysis results, visualizations, and model comparisons.

c.	Action: Compile results and insights into a polished document.

9.	Outcome:
Prepare and deliver the Final Presentation.

a.	Time Frame: By December 17, 2024

b.	Measure: Present findings with a clear narrative, supported by visuals and quantitative analysis.

c.	Action: Develop presentation slides and rehearse delivery.


Success Criteria:
The project will be considered successful if:
•	Completion Date:
The research paper is finalized by December 10, 2024, and the final presentation is delivered by December 17, 2024.

•	Project Deliverables:
The analysis identifies time-related mentions and provides sentiment trends across albums with clear visualizations and reliable sentiment metrics.

•	Effective Demonstration:
The sentiment analysis achieves an accuracy of over 85% for one or more models, supported by detailed evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).

•	Comprehensive Insights:
Results offer meaningful insights into the evolution of Taylor Swift’s lyrical themes and sentiments, supported by data visualizations that are easy to interpret.


Assumptions, Risks, Obstacles:
1.	Assumptions:
   
1.1. The lyrics dataset is accurate, complete, and contains all relevant albums.
  	
1.2. NLP libraries (e.g., nltk, pandas) and machine learning tools (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) will be sufficient for the analysis.

1.3. Sentiment analysis results will provide meaningful insights despite subjective interpretations.

2.	Risks:
   
2.1. Pre-trained sentiment models may misinterpret context or metaphorical language in the lyrics.
  	
2.2. Keyword-based analysis may overlook nuanced time-related references.

2.3. Ambiguity in sentiment scoring may lead to less precise results.

3.	Obstacles:
   
3.1. Preprocessing lyrics data (e.g., removing noise and punctuation) while preserving context may be challenging.
  	
3.2. Iterative refinement of models and visualizations may delay progress.

3.3. Limited time for model optimization and reporting may pose a challenge.
